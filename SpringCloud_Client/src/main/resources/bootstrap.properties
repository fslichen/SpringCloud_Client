# bootstrap.properties is just like application.properties, but it's used for bootstrap.
# In this case, you set the location for spring cloud config server.
# The console prints out : Fetching config from server at: http://localhost:8888
# If you don't write this bootstrap.properties, that's also fine because spring boot contacts localhost at 8888 by default if the spring cloud config server on localhost at 8888 is currently running.
spring.cloud.config.uri = http://localhost:8888
# Corresponds to any-application.properties in SpringCloud_Github.
